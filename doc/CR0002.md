# CR0002: Async method names should end with Async

## Description

This rule enforces that public asynchronous method names end with "Async" to clarify that they run asynchronously and return a `Task` or `ValueTask`.

## Category

Naming

## Severity

Warning

## Enabled by Default

Yes

## Code Examples

### Incorrect

```csharp
public class DataService
{
    public Task<string> GetData() // CR0002 violation
    {
        return Task.FromResult("data");
    }

    public async ValueTask ProcessData(string data) // CR0002 violation
    {
        await Task.Delay(100);
    }
}
```

### Correct

```csharp
public class DataService
{
    public Task<string> GetDataAsync()
    {
        return Task.FromResult("data");
    }

    public async ValueTask ProcessDataAsync(string data)
    {
        await Task.Delay(100);
    }
}
```

## Why This Rule Matters

- Asynchronous methods should be clearly identifiable to consumers.
- The "Async" suffix follows .NET naming conventions established by the Task Parallel Library (TPL).
- It helps developers understand that the method may not complete immediately and returns a awaitable type.

## Notes

- This rule only applies to public methods.
- Methods that are already asynchronous (return `Task` or `ValueTask`) but don't have the "Async" suffix will trigger this warning.
- Private methods are not checked, as they are implementation details.

## Suppression

If you have a specific reason to not use the "Async" suffix:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CR0002
public Task<string> GetData() // Allowed with suppression
#pragma warning restore CR0002
```
